<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a PhD student in `spatial epidemiology` at the `University of Southampton`. I am an interdisciplinary researcher in public health, geography and research methods. Before coming to Southampton, I worked as a `public health officer` with the Ghana Health Service. Also, I worked with Good Neigbors Ghana, an international NGO as `monitoring and evaluation` lead on all projects. I am a member of the `WorldPop` research team at Southampton.
