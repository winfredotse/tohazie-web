<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a PhD student in `spatial epidemiology` at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/geography/postgraduate/research_students/wwdg1n15.page). I am an interdisciplinary researcher with backgrounds in public health, geography and research methods. Before coming to Southampton, I practiced as a `public health officer` with the Ghana Health Service. I worked with Good Neigbors Ghana, an international NGO as `monitoring and evaluation` lead on all projects. I am a member of the [WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org/) research team at Southampton. I am a [Commonwealth](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/) and [ESRC South Coast DTP scholar](https://www.southcoastdtp.ac.uk/), having received generous funding from both institutions for my masters degrees and ongoing PhD.
